## Project Overview  
This is a demo project that demonstrates the use of ShellRoute in GoRouter, enabling seamless switching between the bottom navigation bar and nested categorized routes (pickup/takeout). 

## Features  
- **Simple Routing Configuration**: Use GoRouter declarative route definitions.
- **Nested Routing Architecture**: The main ShellRoute handles the bottom navigation bar, and the secondary ShellRoute handles the switching of ordering categories (pickup/takeout).
