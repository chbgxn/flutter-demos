- This project uses the `Riverpod` state management library to implement a responsive layered architecture. The `Dio` client is singletonized through Provider dependency injection to isolate the network request logic. The front-end derives the state controller through `AsyncNotifierProvider` to uniformly manage the loading, error handling and state synchronization of paging data, and combines `ListView.builder` to achieve infinite scrolling.

- The back-end data source is based on the public simulation API (`/posts` endpoint) of **JSONPlaceholder**, and sends paging requests through the `Dio` client to obtain JSON data.

## Features
- **Deserialization**: Deserialize the JSON data returned by the server into a Dart `Post` object through the `fromJson()` method generated by `json_serializable`
- **Data display**: `ListView.builder` implements on-demand loading
- **Error handling**: Use `OverLay` to implement toast reminders
- **Loading**: Use `Shimmer` (skeleton screen) as a transition animation
- **Refresh**: Support refresh to re-acquire data
